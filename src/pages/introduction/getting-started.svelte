<h1 class="c-h1">Getting started</h1>
<div class="c-content">

  <p>
    To create your first Routify app, simply run
    <code>npx @sveltech/routify init</code>
    in an empty folder.
  </p>
  <p>
    This will install the Routify starter template, in which you'll find an
    example folder (
    <code>src/pages/examples</code>
    ). You can experiment with these examples or just keep them as references.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you're ready to get started on your app, simple delete the contents of
    <code>src/pages/index.svelte</code>
    and start writing your own content. You will still be able to access the
    examples on
    <code>http://localhost:5000/examples</code>
    .
  </p>

  <p>
    When you don't need the examples anymore you can simply delete the examples
    folder.
  </p>

    We recommend reading

    and
    <a href={$url('../parameters')}>parameters</a>
    before creating your first app.
